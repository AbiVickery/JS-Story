    <h1>The P.O.V
        of a rock.
    </h1>
    <!-- <p>
        You roll over into the river. As you do this, you start to sink to the bottom. When you reach the bottom, you see other kinds of rocks sitting there. Along with other kinds of rocks, there are also some different items people have lost to the water. There is even a shiny gold ring. Wonder how that got there... For now, you are stuck at the bottom of the riverbed, waiting for what comes next.
